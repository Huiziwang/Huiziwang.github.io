### Research Experience:

Dissertation: Efficient Classification Methods for Sparse High-Dimensional Count Data with Model Selection as Motivated by Microbe Finder. (May 2021 - Present) 

- Provide new methods for high-dimensional (HD) classification analysis with count data that are computationally efficient, can model zero-inflation and over-dispersion, and allow for model and/or variable selection while avoiding overfitting. (No one method addresses all of these issues simultaneously.)

- Advisor: Dr. Joshua D Habiger
