### Dissertation: 

Efficient Classification Methods for Sparse High-Dimensional Count Data with Model Selection as Motivated by Microbe Finder

- Advisor: Dr. Joshua D Habiger
  
- Provides new methods for high-dimensional classification analysis with count data that are computationally efficient, can model zero-inflation and over-dispersion, and allow for model/variable selection while avoiding overfitting.

-- The model/variable selection process of our methods is similar to the e-probe curation procedure and simplifies the Microbe Finder data generation procedure.
